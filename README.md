# DrawTrees
Given a tree, you are to return a
representation of that tree as a
String[]. The tree will be specified by
a int[], where element i gives the index
of the parent of node i (indexed from 0).
Exactly one element of this int[] will
be -1, corresponding to the root of the
tree. Element i of the int[] corresponds
to element i of names, which gives the name of node i
